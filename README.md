# Design of web application using web component specification

The bachelor thesis deals with use of web components specification in web applications development. In the implementation part, we created [a backend part](https://github.com/Matte478/bachelor-thesis-api), [a client application](https://github.com/Matte478/bachelor-thesis-app) that communicates with the backend part using the REST API and [native web components](https://github.com/Matte478/bachelor-thesis-components) which are used in this application.
